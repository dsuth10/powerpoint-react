# 🧪 Chat and Slides Functionality Testing Guide

## ✅ Implementation Summary

The following fixes have been successfully implemented to connect the Chat and Slides sections:

### 1. **SlidesPage Implementation** ✅
- Connected to chat store to retrieve slide outlines
- Shows outlines from the current or specified session
- Displays helpful messages when no slides are available
- File: `frontend/src/routes/pages/SlidesPage.tsx`

### 2. **Route Configuration** ✅
- Added support for `/slides` and `/slides/:sessionId` routes
- Properly nested routes for session-specific navigation
- Files: `frontend/src/routes/slides/index.route.tsx`, `frontend/src/router.ts`

### 3. **Sidebar Navigation** ✅
- Automatically passes current sessionId when navigating to Slides
- Maintains session context between sections
- File: `frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`

### 4. **Button Labels** ✅
- Changed "Start Generation" to "Build PowerPoint" for clarity
- Added contextual label "Ready to build PowerPoint:"
- Files: `frontend/src/components/slides/GenerationControls.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/chat/ChatContainer.tsx`

### 5. **Session Management** ✅
- Chat store properly maintains currentSessionId
- Session context persists across navigation
- File: `frontend/src/stores/chat-store.ts`

## 🚀 How to Test

### Prerequisites
1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

2. Start the frontend server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open browser at `http://localhost:5173`

### Test Flow 1: Basic Chat to Slides Navigation

1. **Navigate to Chat**
   - Click "Chat" in the sidebar
   - You should be redirected to `/chat/:sessionId` with a new session

2. **Generate Slide Outline**
   - Enter a prompt like: "Create a 5-slide presentation about renewable energy"
   - Press Enter to send the message
   - Wait for the AI to generate slide outlines
   - Verify slide preview cards appear in the chat

3. **Verify Build Button**
   - After slides are generated, look for "Ready to build PowerPoint:" text
   - Verify the button says "Build PowerPoint" (not "Start Generation")
   - The button should be green and have a play icon

4. **Navigate to Slides Section**
   - Click "Slides" in the sidebar
   - You should be taken to `/slides/:sessionId` (same session ID)
   - The slide outline from Chat should be visible
   - You should see the "Build PowerPoint" button

### Test Flow 2: PowerPoint Generation

1. **Start from Slides Section**
   - After completing Test Flow 1, stay in the Slides section
   - Click "Build PowerPoint" button
   - Button should change to "Initializing..."

2. **Monitor Progress**
   - Watch for progress updates (should show "Building... X%")
   - WebSocket connection should provide real-time updates

3. **Download File**
   - When complete, a Download button should appear
   - Click to download the PPTX file
   - Verify the file opens in PowerPoint/LibreOffice

### Test Flow 3: Session Persistence

1. **Create Multiple Sessions**
   - Go to Chat, generate slides
   - Note the session ID in the URL
   - Open a new tab, go to Chat again
   - Generate different slides
   - Note the new session ID

2. **Switch Between Sessions**
   - Navigate directly to `/slides/[first-session-id]`
   - Verify you see the first session's slides
   - Navigate to `/slides/[second-session-id]`
   - Verify you see the second session's slides

3. **Test Empty States**
   - Navigate to `/slides` (no session ID)
   - Should show "No active session" message
   - Navigate to `/slides/invalid-session-id`
   - Should show "No slides generated yet" message

### Test Flow 4: Error Handling

1. **Backend Offline**
   - Stop the backend server
   - Try to generate slides in Chat
   - Should show appropriate error message

2. **Generation Failure**
   - If PPTX generation fails, verify:
     - Error message appears
     - Retry button is shown
     - Can attempt generation again

## 📞 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Console Logs**
   - Browser DevTools console for frontend errors
   - Terminal for backend server errors

2. **Verify API Endpoints**
   - Backend health: `http://localhost:8000/health`
   - API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

3. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Clear site data in DevTools > Application > Storage

4. **Check Network Tab**
   - Verify API calls are successful
   - Check WebSocket connection status
   - Look for failed requests
