# AI-PowerPoint-Generator Development Sequence

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive development sequence for the AI-PowerPoint-Generator project, considering all dependencies, testing requirements, and modern development practices. The sequence is designed for a React 18 + TypeScript frontend with FastAPI Python backend architecture.

## Project Overview

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Router, Zustand, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: FastAPI, Python, Pydantic v2, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
- Testing: Vitest, Cypress, pytest, React Testing Library
- DevOps: Docker, GitHub Actions, Kubernetes
- Real-time: Socket.IO, WebSockets

## Development Phases Overview

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Weeks 1-2)
**Dependencies:** None
**Key Deliverables:**
- Project scaffolding and repository setup
- Development environment configuration
- Core tooling and linting setup
- Initial CI/CD pipeline structure

### Phase 2: Backend Development (Weeks 3-5)
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 completion
**Key Deliverables:**
- FastAPI project structure
- Database schema and models
- Core API endpoints
- Authentication system
- Testing framework setup

### Phase 3: Frontend Development (Weeks 4-7)
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 completion, Phase 2 API contracts
**Key Deliverables:**
- React + TypeScript application setup
- Component library development
- State management implementation
- UI/UX components
- Type-safe API integration

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Weeks 6-8)
**Dependencies:** Phase 2 & 3 substantial completion
**Key Deliverables:**
- Full-stack integration
- End-to-end testing suite
- Performance optimization
- Security testing
- Documentation completion

### Phase 5: Deployment & DevOps (Weeks 8-10)
**Dependencies:** Phase 4 completion
**Key Deliverables:**
- Docker containerization
- Production CI/CD pipeline
- Monitoring and logging setup
- Performance optimization
- Production deployment

## Detailed Stage Dependencies

### Critical Path Analysis
1. **Foundation Setup** → **Backend Development** → **Integration Testing** → **Deployment**
2. **Foundation Setup** → **Frontend Development** → **Integration Testing** → **Deployment**

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- Frontend development can begin once backend API contracts are defined
- Testing can be developed alongside feature implementation
- DevOps infrastructure can be prepared during development phases

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [x] All developers can run the project locally
- [x] Basic CI/CD pipeline functional
- [x] Code quality tools operational
- [x] Development workflow documented

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- [x] All API endpoints functional
- [x] Database schema implemented
- [x] Authentication working
- [x] Backend tests passing (>90% coverage)

### Phase 3 Success Criteria
- [x] Complete UI implementation
- [x] State management functional
- [x] Component library complete
- [x] Frontend tests passing (>90% coverage)

### Phase 4 Success Criteria
- [x] End-to-end tests passing
- [x] Performance benchmarks met
- [x] Security audit passed
- [x] Documentation complete

### Phase 5 Success Criteria
- [x] Production deployment successful
- [x] Monitoring systems operational
- [x] Backup and recovery tested
- [x] Performance monitoring active

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Dependencies
1. **LLM API Integration** (OpenRouter)
2. **Image Generation** (Runware API)
3. **Real-time Communication** (Socket.IO)
4. **PowerPoint Generation** (python-pptx)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Early API testing and validation
- Fallback mechanisms for external services
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance testing under load

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Unit tests written before implementation
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for user workflows
- Performance tests for scalability

### Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint with strict rules
- Prettier for consistent formatting
- Pre-commit hooks for quality checks

## Next Steps

Refer to the individual stage documents for detailed implementation instructions:
- `stage-1-foundation.md`
- `stage-2-backend.md`
- `stage-3-frontend.md`
- `stage-4-integration.md`
- `stage-5-deployment.md`

Each stage document contains specific tasks, dependencies, tools, and success criteria for that phase of development.
