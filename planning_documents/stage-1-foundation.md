# Stage 1: Foundation Setup - Detailed Implementation Guide

## Overview
This stage established the fundamental infrastructure for the AI-PowerPoint-Generator project. All core workflows, quality gates, and cross-platform reliability are now in place.

## Status: COMPLETE (as of 2025-07-12)

### Summary of Work Completed
- **Monorepo directory structure** created: `frontend/`, `backend/`, `docs/`, `.github/`, and supporting subdirectories.
- **Frontend:**
  - Vite + React 18 + TypeScript app scaffolded in `frontend/`.
  - All core dependencies installed and pinned per `versions.md` (TanStack, Zustand, Tailwind, etc.).
  - Tailwind CSS configured (`tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`).
  - ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint installed and configured.
  - **Dockerfile created and verified for frontend.**
  - All frontend development, testing, and CI must use Docker for consistency.
  - Frontend tests (Vitest + React Testing Library) pass in Docker.
- **Backend:**
  - Structure created: `backend/app/`, `backend/tests/`, `backend/scripts/`.
  - `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` populated and pinned.
  - FastAPI entry-point (`app/main.py`) created with CORS and root route.
  - Linting and testing tools installed and configured (`black`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `flake8`, `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `pytest-cov`).
  - **Dockerfile created and verified for backend.**
  - Backend tests, lint, format, and type checks pass in Docker.
  - All code auto-formatted with black.
- **Docker Compose:**
  - `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.dev.yml` populated and verified for both frontend and backend.
- **CI/CD:**
  - GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` created for lint, test, and coverage on all PRs and pushes.
  - Node.js 18.19.0 and Python 3.12.0 enforced in CI and Docker.
- **Documentation:**
  - README updated with all new requirements, Docker workflows, and troubleshooting tips.
  - All contributors must read planning documents before making changes.

### Lessons Learned & Troubleshooting
- Always delete `node_modules` and reinstall in Docker when switching between host and container to avoid native module issues (especially on Windows).
- Ensure all cache and coverage directories are writable in Docker for local runs.
- Use only pinned dependency versions from `versions.md`.
- All quality checks must be run in Docker or CI for consistency.

### Final State
- All Stage 1 tasks are complete.
- Both frontend and backend are fully Dockerized and pass all quality gates.
- CI/CD is live and enforces all standards.
- The project is ready for Stage 2: Backend API and feature development.

**All contributors must use Docker and CI workflows for all quality checks and development.**
