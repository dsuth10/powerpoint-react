# AI-PowerPoint-Generator Monorepo

![CI](https://github.com/dsuth10/powerpoint-react/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)
![CodeQL](https://github.com/dsuth10/powerpoint-react/actions/workflows/codeql.yml/badge.svg)

This repository contains both the frontend (React + Vite + TypeScript) and backend (FastAPI) for the AI-PowerPoint-Generator project.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/` â€“ React 18 + Vite + TypeScript app
- `backend/` â€“ FastAPI app (entry: `backend/app/main.py`)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.19.0 (see `.nvmrc`)
- Python 3.12.0 (see `backend/.python-version`)
- Docker Desktop (for dev workflow)

### Install dependencies

```sh
cd frontend && npm install
cd ../backend && pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Development (Docker Desktop)

PowerShell (Windows):
```powershell
make up
./scripts/smoke.ps1
```

Bash (macOS/Linux):
```sh
make up && sleep 5
curl -f http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health && curl -f http://localhost:5173 || true
```

### Quality Checks

- Lint & test frontend:
  ```sh
  npm run quality:frontend
  ```
- Lint & test backend:
  ```sh
  npm run quality:backend
  ```
- All quality checks:
  ```sh
  npm run quality
  ```

### Environment Variables
- Frontend expects `VITE_BACKEND_URL` and `VITE_WS_URL`. In Docker dev, these are provided by compose. For local overrides, create `frontend/.env.local` with:

  ```env
  VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
  VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8000/ws
  ```

# Stage 1 Foundation Complete

- Both frontend and backend are fully Dockerized. All development, testing, and quality checks must be run in Docker for consistency and cross-platform reliability.
- All lint, format, type check, and test commands pass in Docker for both frontend and backend.
- CI/CD is set up with GitHub Actions (see .github/workflows/ci.yml) for lint, test, and coverage on all PRs and pushes.
- Node.js 18.19.0 and Python 3.12.0 are required (enforced in Docker and CI).
- All dependencies are pinned and must match planning_documents/versions.md.
- Backend: use Makefile targets for lint/test, or run ruff, black, mypy, pytest directly in Docker.
- Frontend: use npm scripts (lint, test, dev, build) in Docker only.
- If you switch between running npm on Windows and in Docker, always delete node_modules and reinstall in Docker to avoid native module issues.
- See planning_documents/stage-1-foundation.md for full setup history and compliance checklist.
- To run all quality checks in Docker:
  - Backend: `docker compose run --rm backend ruff . && docker compose run --rm backend black --check . && docker compose run --rm backend mypy . && docker compose run --rm backend pytest --cov=backend/app --cov-report=term-missing`
  - Frontend: `docker compose run --rm frontend npm run lint` and `docker compose run --rm frontend npm run test -- --run`
- All contributors must read the planning documents before making changes.

## ðŸš¨ Mandatory Docker Workflow for Frontend

To guarantee a consistent, working, and cross-platform development and CI environment for the frontend, **all commands (test, build, lint, etc.) must be run inside the provided Docker container**.

### Why?
- Ensures all contributors and CI/CD use the same Node, npm, and dependency versions
- Prevents platform-specific errors (especially on Windows)
- Guarantees reproducible builds and test results

### How to use
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker build -t ppt-frontend-dev ./frontend
   ```
2. Run commands in the container, e.g.:
   ```sh
   docker run --rm ppt-frontend-dev
   ```
   or for interactive development:
   ```sh
   docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd)/frontend:/app -w /app ppt-frontend-dev sh
   ```

> **Note:** Local Node.js/npm installations on Windows or Mac **must not** be used for these tasks. All documentation and onboarding must reference this workflow. See `.cursor/rules/docker-dev-environment.mdc` for the full policy.
