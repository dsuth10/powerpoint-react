# Rule: Mandatory Docker Development Environment for Frontend

## Purpose
To guarantee a consistent, working, and cross-platform development and CI environment for the frontend, all commands (test, build, lint, etc.) **must** be run inside the provided Docker container.

## Requirements
- All developers and CI/CD pipelines must use the `frontend/Dockerfile` to run tests, builds, and quality checks for the frontend.
- Local Node.js/npm installations on Windows or Mac **must not** be used for these tasks, as they may cause subtle and hard-to-debug errors.
- The canonical workflow is:
  1. Build the Docker image:
     ```sh
     docker build -t ppt-frontend-dev ./frontend
     ```
  2. Run commands in the container, e.g.:
     ```sh
     docker run --rm ppt-frontend-dev
     ```
     or for interactive development:
     ```sh
     docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd)/frontend:/app -w /app ppt-frontend-dev sh
     ```
- All documentation and onboarding must reference this workflow.

## Rationale
- Ensures all contributors and CI/CD use the same Node, npm, and dependency versions.
- Prevents platform-specific errors (especially on Windows).
- Guarantees reproducible builds and test results.

## Enforcement
- PRs and commits that do not follow this rule may be rejected.
- CI/CD must use the Dockerfile for all frontend jobs.
